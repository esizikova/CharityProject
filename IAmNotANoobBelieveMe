Hello everyone!

Many of you might have believed the strange gossip going around this fine office about a certain Albert being a noob. I am proud to tell you that this is not the case... Some of you also made some jokes about this same fellow being too girly -- taking as many as three bags for just the weekend out. I can assure you - none of this is true.
