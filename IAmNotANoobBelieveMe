Hello everyone!

Lots of might have believed the strange gossips going around this fine office about certain Albert being a noob. I am proud to tell you that this is not the case... Some of you also made some jokes about the same fellow being too girly by taking as many as three bags for just the weekend out. I can assure you - non of this is true.
