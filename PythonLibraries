Python libs I consider usefull:

- numpy for fast calculations
- cherrypy for really nice web server
- PIL for drawing images
- re for regular expressions (obviously)
- tweepy for Twitter API
- MySQLdb for connection to MySQL
- json for obvious reasons
- xml.dom.minidom for XML
- lxml.objectify - even better
